            <h4>Ah, your butt is mine, gon' tell you right, ah
                Just show your face in broad daylight, ah
                I'm tellin' you on who I feel, ah
                Gonna hurt your mind, don't shoot to kill
                Shamone, ah, shamone
                Lay it on me, ah, alright
                Ah, I'm givin' you on count to three, ah
                Just show your stuff or let it be, ah
                I'm tellin' you, just watch your mouth, ah
                I know your game, what you're about
                Well, they say the sky's the limit
                And to me that's really true, ah
                But, my friend, you have seen nothin'
                Just wait 'til I get through
                Because I'm bad, I'm bad, shamone (bad, bad, really, really bad)
                You know I'm bad, I'm bad (bad, bad)
                You know it (really, really bad)
                You know I'm bad, I'm bad (bad, bad)
                Shamone, you know (really, really bad)
                And the whole world has to answer right now
                Just to tell you once again
                Who's bad?
                The word is out, you're doin' it wrong, ah
                Gon' lock you up before too long, ah
                Your lyin' eyes gon' tell you right, ah
                So listen up, don't make a fight, ah
                Your talk is cheap, you're not a man, ah
                You're throwin' stones to hide your hands
                Well, they say the sky's the limit
                And to me that's really true, ah
                But, my friend, you have seen nothin'
                Just wait 'til I get through
                Because I'm bad, I'm bad, shamone (bad, bad, really, really bad)
                You know I'm bad, I'm bad (bad, bad)
                You know it (really, really bad)
                You know I'm bad, I'm bad (bad, bad)
