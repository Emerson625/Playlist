            <h3>Lyrics</h3>
            <h4>You're way too beautiful girl
                That's why it'll never work
                You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
                When you say it's over
                Damn all these beautiful girls
                They only wanna do you dirt
                They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
                When they say it's over
                See it started at the park
                Used to chill after dark
                Oh when you took my heart
                That's when we fell apart
                'Cause we both thought
                That love last forever (last forever)
                They say we too young
                To get ourselves sprung
                Oh we didn't care
                We made it very clear
                And they also said
                That we couldn't last together (last together)
                See it's very defined
                You're one of a kind
                But you mash up my mind
                You haffi get declined
                Oh Lord
                My baby is driving me crazy
                You're way too beautiful girl
                That's why it'll never work
                You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
                When you say it's over
                Damn all these beautiful girls
                They only wanna do you dirt
                They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
                When they say it's over
                It was back in '99
                Watching movies all the time
                Oh when I went away
                For doing my first crime
                And I never thought
                That we was gonna see each other (see each other)
                And then I came out
                Mommy moved me down South
            </h4>

            <h4 id="part2">
                Oh I'm with my girl
                Who I thought was my world
                It came out to be
                That she wasn't the girl for me (girl for me)
                See it's very defined
                You're one of a kind
                But you mash up my mind
                You haffi get declined
                Oh Lord
                My baby is driving me crazy
                You're way too beautiful girl
                That's why it'll never work
                You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
                When you say it's over

                They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
                When they say it's over
                Now we're fussing
                And now we're fighting
                Please tell me why
                I am feeling slighted
                And I don't know
                How to make it better (make it better)
                You're dating other guys
                You're telling me lies
                Oh I can't believe
                What I'm seeing with my eyes
                I'm losing my mind
                And I don't think it's clever (think it's clever)
                You're way too beautiful girl
                That's why it'll never work
                You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
                When you say it's over
                Damn all these beautiful girls
                They only wanna do you dirt
                They'll have you suicidal, suicidal, suicidal, suicidal
